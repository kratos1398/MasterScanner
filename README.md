THIS IS THE MASTERSCANNER


If you have been pen testing for a while or doing CTF's over and over again, then the scanning phase must be tedious 
for you. You want to get to the good stuff and get straight to priviledge escalation. Do not worry. I got you covered.

The scans us pen testers usually use like nmap, nikto, dirb, theharvester, etc, are in this script and will be ran 
and saved to certain files. Simply run the file with the target ip address and sit back and relax.

The SCANNING PHASE usually takes the longest in a pen test so this will help speed up the process.
Enjoy :]
